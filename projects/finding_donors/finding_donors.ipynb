    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Trata-se de um modelo de aprendizado supervisionado que usa método de ensemble baseado em múltiplas pequenas árvores de decisão, combinando seus resultados para obter predições melhores.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Aplicação real: É um algoritmo bastante utilizado em bioinformática e outras áreas da medicina, principalmente para dados de mapeamento genéticos (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3387489/). \n",
    "\n",
    "* Vantagens: É considerado um modelo de fácil utilização e parametrização, que lida muito bem com grandes quantidades de features (high dimensional spaces) quanto grandes amostras. Apresenta melhores resultados do que uma simples árvore de decisão e é pouco sensível à outliers. Pode ser usado com bons resultados tanto para problemas de classificação quanto problemas de regressão. Outra vantagem é que o modelo não exige muitos tratamentos nos dados.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Desvantagens: É um modelo propenso a overfitting, mas é possível optar por parametrizações que amenizam isso. Além do mais, é um modelo de difícil interpretação, principalmente se comparado à uma simples árvore de decisão.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Para o caso deste projeto, pode ser um modelo interessante pois os dados são mistos, apresentando tanto dados contínuos quanto categóricos, além de ser um modelo de fácil utilização, sendo útil pelo menos para benchmark com outros modelos.\n",

    "**AdaBoost (Adaptative Boosting)** \n",
    "\n",
    "Trata-se de um modelo de aprendizado supervisionado que usa método de ensamble baseado em classificadores fracos executados repetidamente com atualização dos pesos das predições a cada iteração, dependendo se a classificação foi correta ou fraca, obtendo um classificador muito melhor ao final do processo.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Aplicação real: Pode ser usado para reconhecimento de placa de trânsitos (http://www.lbd.dcc.ufmg.br/colecoes/wvc/2014/0031.pdf) e reconhecimento de faces (http://www.monografias.poli.ufrj.br/monografias/monopoli10017154.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vantagens: É bastante flexível pois pode usar qualquer algoritmo simples como classificador fraco nas iterações (geralmente usa árvores de decisão). Geralmente pode ser usado sem grandes dificuldades em qualquer tipo de dado, seja categórico ou discreto. Também como vantagem possui parametrização simples e de fácil entendimento.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Desvantagens: Dependendo da escolha do tipo de classificador utilizado, pode apresentar problemas de performance e de overfitting (classificador muito complexo) ou underfitting (classificador muito simples). É um problema contornável desde que escolhida a configuração mais adequada ao problema.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Para o caso deste projeto, pode ser um modelo interessante de ser experimentado para confrontar, principalmente, com o Random Forest (também escolhido), uma vez que a árvore de decisão é o classificador \"core\" do Random Forest e pode ser também do AdaBoost. Nesse sentido, ambos os modelos partem de um mesmo método central e chegarão em resultados distintos, o que vai nos permitir um benchmark conciso.\n",

    "* Desvantagens: Não funciona bem em conjuntos de dados muito grandes (exige inversão de matriz, aumentando a complexidade computacional) e não apresenta bons resultandos em dado com grande quantidade de ruídos, uma vez que não consegue encontrar um hiper plano que faça a separação de dados com essa característica. \n",

    "AdaBoost é um modelo de boosting, em outras palavras, ele estimula repetidas vezes um classificador mais fraco até que ele se torne um classificador forte. Além disso, é também um modelo adaptativo, ou seja, em cada repetição ele adapta os pesos do treinamento anterior (favorecendo os acertos e desfavorecendo os erros) e classifica novamente melhorando os acertos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a execução de uma simples árvore de decisão. Ao final, teremos resultados certos e resultados errados na classificação. Digamos que de alguma forma você de mais destaque aos resultados certos e menos destaque aos resultados errados (atribuindo pesos às classificações). Em seguida você executa novamente a árvore de decisão considerando os destaques dos resultados certos e errados, chegará em novos resultados. Repetindo o processo de destacar os resultados certos em detrimento dos errados (atribuindo novos pesos) e executando novamente a classificação chegará um momento em que o classificador acertará praticamente tudo. Ao final, somando-se todos os pesos de cada classificação de cada rodada de execução da árvore de decisão, será encontrado um modelo robusto suficiente para classificar melhor novos dados.\n",

Não apontei as informações de idade (\"age\"), \"education-num\", e horas por semana (\"hours-per-week\"), que,  analisando posteriormente ao gráfico de \"feature importance\" realmente também trazem intuições relevantes sobre a renda anual: provavelmente pessoas mais velhas devem ganhar mais pois já desenvolveram uma carreira mais sólida; da mesma forma, provavelmente trabalhar mais horas por semana talvez tenha um impacto na renda anual. Já a informação de \"education-num\", que estou supondo ser a quantidade de anos em educação formal, pode estar de alguma forma relacionada com \"education_level\", uma das features que indiquei como as 5 mais importantes."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
